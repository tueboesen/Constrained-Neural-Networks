# Constrained Neural Networks

This project tests various ways of adding constraints into a neural network, as detailed in (ArXiv paper to come).

## Installation

The requirements for running this code can be found in requirements.txt and can be install by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

requirements_for_replication.txt contains an exact replicate of the versions and packages I had when I ran the software.

## Running it
The code can be ran from the commandline if desired, but generally I would suggest that you start by running the code through one of the premade examples, and then modify one of those to fit your need.

In order to run the code you need to generate a dataset. The datasets we have used, can be requested by sending an email to: tue.boesen@gmail.com or by opening an issue on github.
