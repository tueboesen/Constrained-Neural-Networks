# We need to specify the data dimensions in a single data sample
# We need the number of particles, and the dimensions for each of those particles
# In the most general case we should support systems where it is just a single vector
# [particle_1_dim_1, particle_1_dim_2,...,particle_1_dim_n,particle_2_dim_1,...,particle_2_dim_m,...]
# Such a system would support any number of dimensions, and support that some particles have more dimensions than others.
# For now we restrict ourselves to a less general system where we assume that each particle has the same number of variables
# In that casea we can have a data structure with 2 dimensions:
# [...,Nparticles,Ndim]
# Hence now we have
